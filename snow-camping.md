# Warm clothing

Torso
- Base layer (merino, for example)
- Fleece
- Two puffy down jackets
- Wind-proof shell

Legs
- Base layer (merino, for example)
- Fleece
- Wind-proof shell
  - Bibs are far warmer since they eliminate the gap between the clothing on your legs and on your torso.

Feet
- Medium-thickness wool socks (not too thick -- you'll just get blisters or lose circulation)
- Bring multiple pairs of socks. They will get wet.
- Ski boots or snow boots depending on whether you are skiing or snow shoeing.
- Some people love down booties for the evening.

Hands
- You want to be able to keep at least one layer of gloves on all the time
  - Even if you are just checking your phone.
  - Even when you are cooking or putting up your tent.
- Thus, you need multiple layers:
  - The inner gloves should work with touch screens and should be thin enough that you can do all tasks with them on.
  - The outer layer should be much warmer.
- You need multiple sets of outer layers.
  - If one of them gets wet you need a backup.
  - One set will be very warm but not very dextrous.
    - A removable liner is good here since it speeds drying.
    - Mittens are warmer than gloves.
  - The other set is for working: still warmer than just the liner, but more dextrous than the other set.
    - A three-finger glove is a good balance of dexterity and warmth.
  - Make sure that the liner stays on your hand when you remove either outer glove.
- You need a way to attach your gloves to your backpack.
  - Otherwise you'll drop them in the snow and get them wet or lose them when you need to take them off.
  - Look for gloves with a loop on the back of the hand or near the fingers, not at the wrist. This allows them to hang with the opening down so that snow doesn't get into them.
- Glove recommendations:
  - Liner: [BD MidWeight Digital Liner Series](http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/gloves/midweight-BD801068_cfg.html#start=1) (Small for Malcolm)
  - Work gloves: [Hestra three-finger gloves](https://hestragloves.com/sport/en-us/gloves/alpine-pro/31472-leather-fall-line-man-woman-three-finger/100/10/) (Size 10 for Malcolm)
  - Warm gloves: [Black Diamond Mercury Mitts](http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/mens-gloves/mercury-mitts-BD801118_cfg.html) (XL for Malcolm)

Head
- A merino buff can be used as a scarf, mask or hat.
- A woolen hat is even warmer than a buff. Bring both.
- A baseball cap fits well under a helmet.
  - But you want one that doesn't have a knob on top or thick seams.
  - The Marmot PreCip Baseball Cap works well.
- Helmet if you want. The Camp Speed USA 2.0 helmet is very light.

# Sleeping

Sleeping bag
- You want a 0F or 15F sleeping bag. Last year 15F was fine with lots of clothing on.
- A down one will be smaller and lighter but more expensive and must be kept dry.

Use a sleeping bag liner.

Sleeping pad
- Use two sleeping pads.
- Bottom: [A closed cell foam pad](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/z-lite/product).
- Top: [Thermarest NeoAir Xtherm](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/neoair-xtherm-and-xtherm-max/product)  is very light and warm. Get it.

Socks
- Keep an extra pair of socks in your sleeping bag that you only use for sleeping.
- This will ensure that they are dry.
- Warming up cold feet in a sleeping bag is hard. Several people last year had discomfort/numbness in their feet that lasted several months. Don't cut corners here.

Tent
- A three-season tent differs from a four-season tent mainly by not being able to withstand winds over 20 mph. We probably won't go out in a storm so a three-season tent should be fine.
- You can use pretty much any tent but there are important considerations for a good tent.
- Can you put it up when your hands are cold or in gloves? Some tents get pretty fiddly.
- If it's snowing, can you put the tent up or open the door without getting lots of snow in it (and perhaps onto your sleeping bag and other gear)?
- Good winter tents have vestibules, which help keep snow outside the main area and provide a space to cook that's somewhat protected.
- Exceptional winter tents have two vestibules so that you can pee in one without having to leave the tent. (People did this last year.)
- Unfortunately, these tents are also heavy.

Snow stakes
- Your regular stakes won't work in snow. You can use skis and poles as make-shift stakes but you may not have enough, and you may want to use them during the day.
- Consider something like http://www.mountainhardwear.com/snow-sand-anchor---set-of-4-OU5981.html.

# Food and water

Stove
- All of your drinking water comes from melting snow.
- You want a stove that lights easily (preferably without a lighter), works even in the wind and works fast. When you are cold and tired you don't want to wait longer than necessary to turn snow into water.
- The best stove for this is the [JetBoil MicroMo](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GPIYZC).
  - It has a built in lighter, works in the wind and is rated for use in cold weather.
  - It's also really fast and is pretty light.

Fuel
- Get the small canisters (127g or so) that you can fit inside the jet boil.
- This makes it more convenient to make water.

Thermos
- Water will freeze quickly. Don't bother with a regular water bottle.

Ziplock bags
- Many things are hard to open in gloves.
- Consider putting them in ziplock bags ahead of time.
- Use the bags with sliders, not two strips that must be pressed together (these are impossible in gloves).

Water purification
- Sean doesn't purify snow but Malcolm's avi instructor recommends it.
- [AquaMira](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OR111G) is an easy, cheap and light way to do this.

# Misc gear

Shovel
- With a shovel you can dig a pit to cook in, make a wall around your tent, etc.
- Normal avi shovels are expensive and heavy. They are also somewhat complicated to assemble in gloves and can jam. (Last year, Malcolm's shovel jammed so that the handle and head could not be separated.)
- Get a [Snow Claw](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IMTPYY):
  - It's cheap, light and very simple.
  - You can even use it to stay warm when sitting in the snow.

# Tips

Wet things
- Things will get wet.
- And everything that's wet will freeze, especially over night. It definitely won't dry.
- Some online sources suggest that you can hang things in your tent to get them to dry but last year the tents were far too cold for that.
- Thus, everything that's wet must be in your sleeping bag with you. This includes:
  - The liners in your ski boots
  - Your socks from the day
  - Your gloves
- This is one more reason to wear some clothing in the sleeping bag -- to insulate yourself from all the wet junk in there with you.

Sleds:
- Last year the sleds were not popular.
- Rumors about not noticing weight on a sled did not turn out to be true.
- People with sleds moved more slowly and were more restricted in where they would go (such as traversing).

Water
- If you bring your own JetBoil you can make water each time you stop.
- In about seven minutes you can go from snow to warm water.
- You can let the two chemicals in AquaMira mix during the same time.
- If you do this then you only need to carry a liter or so of water.

Toilet
- You have to take off lots of clothing (especially with most bibs) and your gloves.
  - How do you avoid getting horribly cold/wet while doing this (especially if it's snowing)?
- Best practice is to poop in a bag and pack it out.
  - Who's doing that?
